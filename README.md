## Data balancing to beat bias aimed at avoiding overfitting and making wrong predictions

Clean data plays a huge role in how our machine learns and performs prediction. Here we check the accuracy of data with an imbalanced dataset and then do operations to ensure the dataset is balanced using various techniques. Then train the model on the balanced dataset. The results show that balanced datasets help improve accuracy of model and perform reliable predictions.
